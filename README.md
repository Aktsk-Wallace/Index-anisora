## üí° Abstract
Animation has gained significant interest in the recent film and TV industry. Despite the success of advanced video generation models like Sora, Kling, and CogVideoX in generating natural videos, they lack the same effectiveness in handling animation videos. Evaluating animation video generation is also a great challenge due to its unique artist styles, violating the laws of physics and exaggerated motions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive system, **AniSora**, designed for animation video generation, which includes a data processing pipeline, a controllable generation model, and an evaluation dataset. Supported by the data processing pipeline with over 10M high-quality data, the generation model incorporates a spatiotemporal mask module to facilitate key animation production functions such as image-to-video generation, frame interpolation, and localized image-guided animation. We also collect an evaluation benchmark of 948 various animation videos, the evaluation on VBench and human double-blind test demonstrates consistency in character and motion, achieving state-of-the-art results in animation video generation.

Features:

1. We develop a comprehensive video processing system that significantly enhances preprocessing for video generation.

2. We propose a unified framework designed for animation video generation with a spatiotemporal mask module, enabling tasks such as image-to-video generation, frame interpolation, and localized image-guided animation.

3. We release a benchmark dataset specifically for evaluating animation video generation.

|In this video, a young woman with long blonde hair can be seen looking out from behind a car door at night. The car is parked under a starry sky with a full moon illuminating the scene. The woman appears to be in a state of worry, as evidenced by her facial expression and the way she grips the car door. |  <img src="assets/motion_comics_tui_la_5_firstlast_first.png" width="800"/> || <img src="assets/motion_comics_tui_la_5_firstlast_last.jpeg" width="800"/>|![Demo](assets/motion_comics_tui_la_5_firstlast.gif)|
